## About

An additional Jupyter notebook
and `beamerswitch` report
in my own style is created.

The `beamerswitch` report
is a LaTeX source that generates
a presentation as well as a
written report at the same time.
This can be done with LaTeX.

The plan is for this to work non-destructively as much as possible if there
are imposed hierarchies in the file directory. My suggestion
is to remove the subdirectories with the file directory already imposed,
and use this tool for smaller subdirectories first.

## Getting Started

Run the executable provided for 64-bit Windows. Or create builds
for other operating systems using ```go build````
