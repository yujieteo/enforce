## About

This project enforces a directory structure 
on an existing folder that is similar to the one here.

An additional Jupyter notebook
and ```beamerswitch``` report
in my own style is created.

The ```beamerswitch``` report
is a LaTeX source that generates
a presentation as well as a 
written report at the same time.
This can be done with LaTeX.

## Getting Started

Run the executable provided for 64-bit Windows. Or create builds
for other operating systems using ```go build````
